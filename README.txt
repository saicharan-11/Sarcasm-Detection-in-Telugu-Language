You can run the note book cell wise (but to run postagger it takes long time)
So i had added the pickle file of Pos tags genereted.


Modules needed:
1)python-3.*
2)Sklearn
3)Pickle
4)Pandas
5)Numpy

If you run directly from Load Pickle file directly then 

1) tokens.pkl are the sentences with removed stopwords and punctuations
2)Postags.pkl are the string of postags to respective sentence
3)y.pkl is the labels(sarcastic or not)
